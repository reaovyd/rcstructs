A library of common data structures that are implemented in C
-
The data structures that are implemented here so far are linked lists, maps, sets, priority queue, balanced binary search tree. The purpose of this repository was really for me to use these data structures in other projects (if necessary, of course), but anyone can use them if they find it useful.
